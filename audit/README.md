# Audit API

## Draft

# Background

## Context and Goals

MDS enables cities or municipal operators to receive information directly from regulated / permitted entities (“providers”) relating to the behavior of vehicles and devices in the public right of way. During initial onboarding of providers and thereafter for maintenance purposes, it may be necessary for the city or its agents to attempt to audit or otherwise ensure that this information is correct.

This question of auditable compliance relates both to the correct formatting of data (e.g., no malformed inputs), its accuracy, and its timeliness. These three factors together are important contributors to the evaluation of the _technical compliance_ of a provider. This is to say, the compliance of regulated / permitted vehicles or devices with the specific requirements laid out both by MDS as a system of interfaces, and by the specific program terms or requirements (e.g. an event telemetry submission latency window, a telemetry temporal resolution requirement, and for the evaluation of the precision of such submissions consistent with GPS accuracy requirements or other program terms that may vary from city to city or within the scope of permitted and regulated program operations.

This specification defines an API which facilitates in-field data collection and evaluation of the technical compliance of providers. It is not intended as a substitute for other evaluative, cooperative, or corrective measures in the implementation or ongoing operations of MDS.

**Key users of this API are expected to include:**

1. City officials or their agents operating MDS (to ensure correct operations)
2. Ongoing field compliance and enforcement applications (for ongoing compliance or enforcement activities, consistent with other policy governance, e.g. parking)
3. Regulated or permitted entities (to facilitate self-evaluation)

The same API which is intended, at present, for an audit purpose may also find value in producing a verifiable, auditable mechanism to collect _non-provider-ride information_ in a consistent manner. Thus, this same API also has some applicability for other purposes, for example in facilitating the collection of information in an MDS-compliant format for testing.

## Potential Roadmap

This initial version has several limitations, largely defined by the choice to shift considerable logic and post-processing of meta-data to client to facilitate initial iterative discovery of user needs.

Some of the gaps to be evaluated in the near term for inclusion:

1. Additional server-side support of audit client event resolution (e.g. trip_enter and trip_leave)
2. Allowances for more edge case behaviors (e.g., fuzzy matching of rides and audit rides in order to allow for more open-ended audit workflows)
3. Further notions of authorship and record management
4. “Review / approve” workflow, including mutable constructs
5. Broader support for server-side calculations, matching, and assessment

These and other areas of potential development are expected to be enhanced through feedback from municipal and other users.

# Authorization

See [Authorization](../common/CommonStandards.md#authorization).

# Endpoints

The Audit API consists of endpoints for reporting issues and collecting events and telemetry during the auditing of a trip using a provider vehicle.

## Start an Audit

```
POST /audit/trips/{audit_trip_id}/start
```

This endpoint shall be called once at the very beginning of an audit before any interaction occurs with the provider vehicle/application.
